# Language-Translator
CA114 Project: Language Translator â€“ Shell script, Scripting Language. Lines of data from 6 different languages, on a webpage, were given to us. We were required to write a program that downloaded and split the data into its own language. This program would then be run on the terminal and the user would choose their source and target languages. The program I wrote gave the option to select the data randomly or by line length in a user friendly, easy to follow manner.
